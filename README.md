# IFF - [Identification Friend or Foe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_friend_or_foe)

An LLM-powered search engine for querying aircraft information using natural language.

## Overview

IFF enables users to search and discover aircraft details through conversational queries. The system leverages large language models to understand natural language inputs and performs intelligent, multi-step searches to find and synthesize relevant information.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Search using conversational language with full conversation context
- **Agentic Search**: Automatically performs multiple searches to comprehensively answer complex queries
- **Information Synthesis**: Combines data from multiple sources into coherent responses
- **Rich Output Formats**: Presents results as tables, graphs, timelines, and other visual formats where appropriate
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines embedding similarity and semantic parsing for accurate results
- **Visual Function Blocks**: Built on a modular, visual programming paradigm

## Technology Stack

- **Search Engine**: Typesense or SQLite
- **Vector Store**: TBD
- **Prompt Optimization**: DSPy
- **Architecture**: Visual function blocks

## Planned Platforms

- Web application
- Mobile application
- ChatGPT app integration

## Development Roadmap

1. Prototype search system with structured queries
2. Natural language to search query translation
3. Integration testing and iteration
4. DSPy pipeline for prompt optimization
5. Benchmarking with optimized prompts
6. Web and mobile app development
